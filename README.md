Reverse Engineering + Malware Analysis

What Is Reverse Engineering Malware?
Reverse engineering malware is the process of analyzing malware to understand its functionality and purpose. This process can determine how to remove the malware from a system or create defenses against it.
Security researchers need to be able to not only understand how malware works but also predict how it will evolve.
What Are Static and Dynamic Malware Analysis?
Static analysis can be done by examining the code itself or looking at its metadata, such as timestamps or file hashes. Static analysis can be used to understand what a piece of malware does without worrying about it causing any damage.
Dynamic analysis is the process of executing malware to observe its behavior . This can be done by running the code in a controlled environment, such as a virtual machine or sandbox. Dynamic analysis can be used to identify how malware behaves when it is running. 
Both static and dynamic analysis have their strengths and weaknesses. Static analysis is less likely to cause damage to a system, but it can be challenging to understand what a piece of malware does without executing it. Dynamic analysis is more likely to cause damage to a system, but it can provide more insight into how malware works.

Reverse engineering is more about understanding how something works, while malware analysis is more about understanding what something does.

Tools
IDA Pro is a really good tool for analyzing various samples of malware. It also has a good add-on called HEX Rays Decompiler, which is a tool that can convert assembly language into more easily read pseudocode
